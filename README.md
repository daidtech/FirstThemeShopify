# FirstThemeShopify

FirstThemeShopify is a personal practice Shopify theme built to learn **Liquid**, **Dawn architecture**, and **Online Store 2.0**.

## What I Practice
- Shopify Liquid basics (`{{ }}` and `{% %}`)
- Dawn theme structure (layout, templates, sections, blocks)
- Creating custom pages and sections
- Online Store 2.0 concepts
- Responsive storefront UI

## Tech Stack
- Shopify
- Liquid
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript (basic)
- Dawn theme

## Status
🚧 Learning project / In progress

## Notes
This theme is **not intended for production use**. It is built purely for practice and skill improvement.
